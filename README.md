# Pomodoro clock:
"The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student"

I made this project for the freeCodeCamp "Front End Development Libraries" free certification.

# Used Technologies:

I mainly used react props, react hooks for this project following the logic of this [Tutorial](https://thewebdevcoach.com/freecodecamp-pomodoro-clock-00:-create-react-app-development-environment)

for the style I tried to use some external components but they weren't working with the freeCodeCamp test module, so I recreated a classic digital alarm clock and with neumorphic buttons with CSS and external fonts only.
